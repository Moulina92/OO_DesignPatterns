## Problem Statement
```
Develop a text editor application in Java that allows users to input text and apply different
formatting styles (eg : uppercase,lowercase). ALso there should be systems waiting for the text
to be updated. Everytime a text is updated, the text editor should notify the observers. Also 
the text formatting operations should be encapsulated and execute them on the editor's text.
