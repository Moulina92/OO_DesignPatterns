## Problem Statement
```
Develop a library system that manages various types of library items such as books, CDs, and DVDs.

Each item has a title, a unique identifier, ans a type-specific property(e.g. author for books).

The system should allow users to check our items, calculate late fees based on the item types, and determine the total
value of all items in the library.
