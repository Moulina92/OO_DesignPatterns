## Structural Design Patterns

## Problem Statement
```
We are developing a multimedia streaming application that supports various types of media
including videos, audio tracks, and images. The application needs to handle different media 
formats, provide efficient storage, and enable seamless playback for users. To achieve this, 
we will implement multiple structural design patterns to organize and manage the multimedia
elements effectively.
